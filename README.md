## Finding the Component

This component can be found under the **CoreAcademy** account on Community Content.

## Overview

The Player List component will show who is in-game to all players. Knowing who is in-game can improve the experience for players and can make the game feel more alive and active.

The player list will display the playerâ€™s avatar in the list, and supports hiding and showing it using the bindings manager.

## How to use

A binding set has been included with the template so players can hide/show the player list.

The root of the template contains 3 custom properties.

- **VisibleByDefault**

  This is the collection of NFTs you want to pull from.

- **CanHide**

  If enabled, and the action has been set, then players can hide and show the player list.

- **Action**

  The action to check. Make sure this is in your bindings manager, or use the Player List binding in your Hierarchy.
